In my project, I have included an image from the internet which has been cropped for simplicity. However, I own no rights to the image.

I have implemented the PCA using the library functions in pca.py while in manual_pca.py, I am implementing the PCA from scratch using only numpy to gain a stronger mathematical basis. 
I have included the original as well as the lower resolution reconstruction.
